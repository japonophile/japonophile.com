The word _hanami_ (花見, means "watch the flowers": _hana_ = "blossom", and _mi_ "watch, look") is often interpreted in various ways:

For some people, it means walking through the gardens or parks and observe the [cherry trees](http://www.japonophile.com/article_sakura_en.html) (this interpretation is the closest to the ethymology).

In this case, although one usually chooses a place where there are indeed some cherry trees, these are not always the main attraction. However, it is important that the _hanami_ takes place, if possible, on "the" day where _sakuras_ are in full bloom (満開 _mankai_). And this is so important, that the days before, newspapers announce the estimated date of blooming for each region.

_Hanami_ are held with friends, collegues or with family... The _sakuras_ are only blooming two weeks per year: let's not miss that chance!
