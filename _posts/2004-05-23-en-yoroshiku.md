_Yoroshiku o-negai shimasu_ よろしくお願いします. Japanese language is full of such "ready-to-use" expressions.

 

Each of these expressions should be used in certain situations and this one is a well-known example. Literally: "I beg your kindness", or simply: "be nice with me", "welcome me", etc. Japanese people use it in various situations.

For example (and this is probably the meaning it had when I heard it for the first time), when introducing oneself. Japanese people are very much used to briefly introduce themselves, in what they call a _jiko shoukai_ (自己紹介, "self-introduction"): telling your name, what you do and what you like (your hobbies, _shumi_ 趣味), and inevitably ending by the consacrated locution: _yoroshiku o-negai shimasu_. "Please welcome me among you and be nice to me".

### Did you know it?

Some people will write "4649" for _yoroshiku_ (_yo\[n\]-ro\[ku\]-shi-k\[y\]u_). And deliquents (_bosozoku_ 暴走族) like to write it phonetically in _[kanji]({% post_url 2005-03-12-fr-kanji %})_. For example: 四路死苦 ...

A completely different situation where the same expression is used is when formulating a request or asking a favor. For example: "Please don't use you cellular phone on the train ... _yoroshiku o-negai shimasu_ ... please!"

This expression is thus very useful and I really recommend everyone to remember it, because it is widely used. Finally, let me also mention the "familiar" version: _yoroshiku_ よろしく, which is used among friends or family. For example: "Honey, could you help me carry my bags? _Yoroshiku!_" (="Too kind, honey, I knew I could count on you!")
