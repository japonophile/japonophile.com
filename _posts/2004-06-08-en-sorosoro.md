I like this Japanese expression: _sorosoro_ そろそろ cannot be translated litteraly, but it means something like "soon", "gradually", "slowly"...

 

### Another uncompleted sentence...

Another example of an "uncompleted" sentence is the word commonly used to great one another: "konnichi-wa". While in English, we great each other with an exclamation ("hello!" which was first used over a telephone line), the Japanese will say "in this day.............." and it is up to the greated person to imagine what's going on "in this day"...

An example is worth a thousand of words:  
Ex1- "_sorosoro tsukarete kita_" (そろそろ疲れてきた) = "I'm _starting_ to get tired".  
Ex2- "_sorosoro dekakeyô_" (そろそろ出かけよう) = "_it will soon be a good time to_ go out".  
I agree, so far, nothing really funny.

But what I find interesting is that this expression sometimes implies a whole eluded sentence. So, for example, when a Japanese is invited at a friend's place, she won't say "I'd soon be thinking to go", no this would be far too rude! Instead, she'll say: "sorosoro..." and her friend will understand.
