_Tsukiji_ (築地) is the fish market in Tokyo. It is recommended to get there quite early (those who are fit enough can go out, for example in _Roppongi_ the night before, and go directly to _Tsukiji_ at dawn: no need to go and sleep at all!).![Fishers carts in Tsukiji, Tokyo]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/04/tsukijicarts.jpg)

The intense activity that animates _Tsukuji_ from early in the morning is very impressive: people go back and forth, riding small vehicles with a noisy engine, which allow them to carry several hundred kilograms of fish. Inside, salespeople shout allheartedly to attract customers.

A fisherman with whom we were talking challenged us with the following riddle: "What is the biggest fishing harbor in Japan?" Answer: _Narita_! Indeed, purchases made in _Tsukiji_ every morning go far behind japanese borders. (Note: fish carried by the man on the picture are frozen tuna).

Eventually, after having seen the market (and made your shopping), I advice you to go and have breakfast in one of the many surrounding _[sushi]({% post_url 2004-04-28-en-sushi %})_ restaurants: you'll find there raw fish of the best quality.
