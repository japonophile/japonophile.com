_Combini_ (コンビニ) is one of the numerous words borrowed to English and arranged "à la japonaise". _Combini_ means _convenience store_, a shop that is indeed quite convenient because open 24 hours a day all year long and sells all sorts of useful items.

_Combini_'s sell for example _[bento]({% post_url 2004-05-02-en-bento %})'s_ or _[manga]({% post_url 2004-06-22-en-manga %})'s_, and they really became a necessity especially for _salary men_ going back home when all classical stores are closed.

Today, _combini_'s are actually so widespread that, even when living in the countryside, you'll always be within reach of one of them.
