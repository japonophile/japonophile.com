Japanese hospitality is noteworthy. Whatever the restaurant you enter, you'll not wait more than one minute before being served.

 

![o tefuki]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/06/otefuki.jpg)Most often, they'll bring you a glass of water, green tea or _bancha_ (see the article about tea).

And at the same time, they also bring you a humid towel called _o-tefuki_ (お手拭, literally: "wipe-hand") which, besides wiping one's hand as the name indicates it, can also be used to refresh one's face. Usually, the _tefuki_ is hot in the winter and cold in the summer, which I find very nice.
