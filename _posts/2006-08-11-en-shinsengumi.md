The _Tama_ 多摩 region in Western Tokyo is the birthplace of the _shinsen-gumi_ 新選組, an armed gang fully dedicated to let the "true justice" be respected.

 

The story of the _shinsen-gumi_ (literal meaning: "team of the new elected") started about 140 ago, in the _Kanto_ plain, nearby the _Tama_ river (_Tama-gawa_). A group of young men and women who dreamed becoming _samurai_ one day, but knew this privilege was reserved to a cast of people, went to see the _Shogun_ in _Kyoto_, and told him their ideal: to protect the _bakufu_ (the _shogun_'s government) and to let the "true justice" reign (_makoto no gi_ 誠の義). This initiative was welcomed by the _shogun_, who recognized this group of young people: the _shinsen-gumi_ was born!

It is also during that period, that [black ships]({% post_url 2004-05-04-en-kurofune %}) come all the way from America, and that Japan starts opening to the outside world. The _shinsen-gumi_ is very busy!

However, the story ends up awkwardly, when _Kyoto_'s shogun is overthrown (1867) and the emperor in _Tokyo_ takes over the power. Our brave defenders of the country are now considered as rebels and are forced to run away.

_The _shinsen-gumi_ story is quite popular, thanks to the TV series broadcast on NHK, which relates this marvellous adventure!_
