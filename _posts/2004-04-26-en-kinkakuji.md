_Kinkakuji_ 金閣寺, means "golden pavilion". And it is not exaggerated: it is really a pavilion _completely covered with gold_! The _Kinkakuji_ we see today is actually a reconstruction of the original, which has been completely destroyed by the fire. A story tells us that a monk searching for perfection and irritated by the "too perfect" look of the _Kinkakuji_ set it to fire.

Other interesting fact: there also exists a _Ginkakuji_ 銀閣寺, "silver pavilion", but this one is not at all covered with silver. It seems that the man who planned to build it got peniless before having started to put the first gram of silver. It's a pity! But the gardens of the _Ginkakuji_ are really worth passing by.
