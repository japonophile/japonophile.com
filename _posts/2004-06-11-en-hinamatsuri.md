On March 3, in Japan, takes place the _Hina Matsuri_ ひな祭り, the "Dolls Festival".

 

On this day, girls have the place of honor in Japan (so they are not jealous on May 5, the ["Children's Day"]({% post_url 2004-05-05-en-koinobori %}), dedicated to the boys!).

Hina Matsuri dolls

  
Little japanese girls receive when they are young, beautiful dolls called _hina ningyô_. These dolls are however not meant to play with (which is probably very disappointing for the girls): they represent the emperor and empress on the day of their bridal, and they are carefully placed on a shelf covered with red felt. Several days before the _Hina Matsuri_, the dolls are taken out from their box (they are usually stored in a big closet) and exposed until the day of the festival.

There is a common belief, that if the _hina_ dolls are not promptly put back after the festival, the girl will need more time to find a husband!

The face of a Hina doll is its soul

Nowadays, many families only keep miniature dolls, due to the lack of space.
