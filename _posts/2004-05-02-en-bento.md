Millions of japanese of all ages carry their _o-bentoh_ (お弁当) along every day. You propably got it, I'm talking about the "honorable lunch"!

But the main difference between the _bentoh_ and our western lunchboxes,![O bento]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/bento.jpg) is that the basic ingredient is not bread, but rice (indeed, most japanese people eat rice (at least) twice a day -even three times, when they get it for [breakfast](http://www.japonophile.com/article_choshoku_en.html)). Other foods, called _o-kazu_ (おかず) are served with rice. In English, one would say: the main dish, but japanese cuisine rather consists out of a great variety of small dishes. This is true for the _bentoh_.

There are many kinds of _bentoh_: industrially produced (packed in a plastic tray, and sold in _[combinis](http://www.japonophile.com/article_combini_en.html)_), prepared every morning by the mother for her children (packed into a nice little handkerchief), or the _ai-sai-bentoh_ (愛妻弁当, prepared by the youg wife by love for her husband), without mentioning the _eki-ben_ (駅弁, sold in [train stations](http://www.japonophile.com/article_densha_en.html) and which gives you a foretaste of travel)...
