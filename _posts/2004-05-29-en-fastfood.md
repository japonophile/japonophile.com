Japan, a country of unceasing activity, counts a great number of fast foods.

Among them, _Maku Donarudo_, well established in Japan, is of course influence by local culture: the Japanese menu includes, among other items, a _teriyaki burger_ (_teriyaki_ is a sweet sauce that perfectly suits beef), or in some season the _tsukimi burger_ (_tsukimi_ 月見 means "watch the moon", probably coming from the egg evoking the moon). The audience of _Makku_ mostly consists of young people (on the picture, some junior high-school girls wearing their school uniform).

But Japan also counts lots of traditional restaurants, offering a rapid an unexpensive service (one could say "local fast foods").

![Japanese fast food]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/foodtickets.jpg)Many restaurants like this one are equipped with ticket vending machines: you buy a ticket corresponding to what you want to eat, and drop it on the counter. Service is very fast and cheap. But these places are very tight, and customers are often eating on a small counter facing a wall, or even standing!

_Most restaurants (not only fast foods, by the way) display plastic reproductions of the food they serve. This is very appreciated when you can't read the menu!_
