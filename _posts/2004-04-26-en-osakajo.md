_Osaka-joh_ (大阪城), the Osaka Castle is really worth seeing, even though it is in fact only a concrete reproduction of the original building (japanese people are not really sensitive to the original character of their buildings; the [Kinkakuji](http://www.japonophile.com/article_kinkakuji_en.html) is by the way also a reproduction).

The inside of the castle has unfortunately not be reconstituted at all. Instead, you will however see a museum, which outlines the history of the castle and of Taikoh _Toyotomi Hideyoshi_, considered as the unifier of Japan.
