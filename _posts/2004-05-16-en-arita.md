![Arita, city of porcelain]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/aritamap.jpg)_Arita_ (有田, _Saga_ prefecture) can be considered as the birthplace of porcelain in Japan.

All this started a long time ago, when a man from Korea baked the first white porcelain in _Arita_, Thereafter, beginning 1600, Dutch people arrived in _Nagasaki_ (neighboring prefecture) and showed a great interest for _Arita_\-ware. Without the Dutch, porcelain artwork would probably never have developed in _Arita_. Other important influences are owed to China, Germany, and other european countries.

![Porcelain shop in Arita]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/aritayakiten.jpg)When I visited _Kyushu_ island, I was fortunate to stay a while in _Arita_, little city that could easily have remained unnoticed, and where I discovered plenty of porcelain shops, witnesses of more than 400 years history of porcelain in Japan.

  
  
_"Arita-yaki" 有田焼 (literally: baked \[porcelain\] of Arita), this is how Arita-ware is called in Japanese._
