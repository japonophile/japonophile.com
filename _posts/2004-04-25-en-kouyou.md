There is a time for everything. A time for [cherry trees](http://www.japonophile.com/article_sakura_en.html) in full bloom. A time for autumn leaves.

In the fall, making long distances to see the trees in their autumnal colors is a tradition in the Land of the Rising Sun.![Autumnal colors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/04/kouyou.jpg) The four seasons have a great importance in Japan, and the fall is one of the most beautiful seasons, because it is often mild (in Tokyo, at least) and therefore perfect to escape in the nature. Some people even go on an itinerant journey, progressively going down to the South, because autumn starts earlier in the North (and in the mountains).

In Japanese, one says "go and watch the kohyoh" (紅葉, literally the "red leaves"), and it is an activity I really recommend you!
