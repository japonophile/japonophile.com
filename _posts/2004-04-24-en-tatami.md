Kind of carpet made of dry rice straws, the tatami is made of fixed size tiles of 90cm x 180cm (\*), and it is therefore also a unit of area.

![Washitsu]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/04/washitsu.jpg)Although the tatami is often replaced by other flooring in modern appartments, most japanese people still like to have a _washitsu_ (和室, traditional japanese room), which they use as a living room or as a bedroom. The size of _washitsu_'s is standardized: rooms of 6 or 8 tatami are the most common, but one also sometimes sees tiny rooms of 4.5 tatamis.

**Important notice!** It is mandatory to take off your shoes to walk on tatami: Japanese people become mad if you forget to do so!

  
(\*) The size of a tatami is not accidental: it represents the size of a lying man...
