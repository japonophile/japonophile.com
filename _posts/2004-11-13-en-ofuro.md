Who hasn't dreamed of a nice warm bath? But in Japan, _warm_ (I should say hot) baths are not only part of everyday life, they are an insititution!.

![Unit bath]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/11/unitbath.jpg)"Honey, your bath's boiling!" (あなた！お風呂がわいたよ！ _anata! O-furo ga waïta yo!_). This helps to figure out how warm japanese baths are! (By the way, this expression was used a few years ago, when one used to boil water in a metal bath by making fire underneath; no, it's not supposed to be a torture instrument!). The bath water is so hot that, after the whole family has taken a bath, it's still warm enough to wash the laundry!

Although nowadays most households do have a bathtub at home (for even when space is lacking, one always has enough space for a "unit bath" ユニットバス), not so long ago, most people used to attend the public baths, the _sentoh_ (銭湯). The athmosphere in the _sentoh_ is very nice: there is usually more room than at home, ![Sento, japanese public bath]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/11/sento.jpg)with a space to carefully wash ones body before plunging into hot water, and relax, not forgetting to exchange the latest gossips.

Recognizable to their high chemney, _sentoh_ are still to be found today, especially in old towns. So you happen to find one, don't hesitate to step in, you won't be disappointed.
