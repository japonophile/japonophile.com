The _mochi_ 餅, a cake made of rice, plays an essential role during the Japanese New Year celebrations.

 

The _mochi_ is quite a strange kind of food: a sort of cake made of rice dough, quite heavy. Not easy to eat at all: you chew it, it never ends. Fresh _mochi_ is relatively maleable and flexible, but if you leave it for a while, it becomes dry and crispy.

Although _mochi_ are now sold in every supermarket in Japan, and at any time of the year, it nevertheless remains a typical New Year food. While _mochi_ found in stores are little rectangular-shaped blocks, New Year _mochi_ are round-shaped (like a flattened ball) and is therefore commonly called _kagami-mochi_ (鏡餅, literaly "mochi-mirror" because its shape is pretty much like a mirror).

### Mochi Tsuki

_Mochi_ is made of "overcooked" rice (called _mochi-gomé_ 餅米), which is vigorously battered until it becomes a thick dough. This fabrication process is called _mochi-tsuki_ (餅搗き) , and is traditionally carried out using a big wooden hammer, which is used to beat the rice in a huge bowl hollowed out of a big trunk (see picture). The "mochi making parties" (_mochi-tsuki taikai_ 餅つき大会) are still very common nowadays, organized in schools, clubs or by some companies.

After having poured the overcooked rice (actually steamed rice) in the trunk, men will take the maul in turn to pound the rice. While one is batting, another will use the time when the maul is in the air to quickly knead the hot rice dough. Of course, this requires a perfect synchronization between the batter and the assistant, which is why the audience will often give the rythm, by its cheerful support.

Here is what the _mochi_ looks like after the rice has been pounded. The next step will be to divide the dough, make balls and flatten them to give them their traditional shape. But if they are going to be eaten right away, small balls the size of a mouthfull are fine too.

### Bon Appetit!

There are plenty of _mochi_ recipes, really for every taste:

Kinako mochi

- For example, it can be soaked into [red bean]({% post_url 2004-11-03-fr-anko %}) paste or juice, this is called _o-shiruko_ (お汁粉).
- It can also be dipped in a sweet powder called _kinako_ 黄粉 (literally: "yellow powder"), made from fried soy beans peeled. By the way, this is my favorite _mochi_ recipe!
- Toasted, then wrapped in a foil of _nori_ (seaweed), and flavored with soy sauce.
- And I should not forget to mention _o-zoni_ (お雑煮), a special New Year's recipe: _mochi_ is served in a kind of vegetable soup. Mmmmh!
