![A beach of Izu]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/izubeach2.jpg)Famous for its [hot springs]({% post_url 2004-05-06-en-onsen %}) (_onsen_, 温泉) and for its white sand beaches, the peninsula of _Izu_ (伊豆), located in _Shizuoka_ prefecture just South of Tokyo, is a perfect destination to spend a few days holiday.

![Map of Izu]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/izumap.jpg)On the East coast, _Atami_ (熱海) is a city developed around an _onsen_, which is very much appreciated by the inhabitants of Tokyo because they can reach it quite easily. A little more to the South, _Itô_ (伊東) is the city where the English seaman William Adams stayed after his shipwreck along Izu coast. He became counselor of the _Shohgun_ and supervised the construction of the first western style trade ship built in Japan.

![Oodaru in Izu]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/izuoodaru.jpg)At the extreme South of the peninsula, the city of _[Shimoda]({% post_url 2004-05-06-en-onsen %})_ (下田) is famous because it is there that was signed the first "Treaty of Friendship" between Japan and the United States, which became the starting point of the cultural and economical opening of Japan to the rest of the world.

Back to the North inside the peninsula is a luxuriant region, with among other the "Seven Waterfalls" (_Nana-daru_, 七滝) which are worth seeing.

![Mishima Taisha in Izu]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/05/mishimataisha.jpg)Finally, in Northern Izu, you will find the temple of _Shuzenji_ (修善寺) where a lot of important figures of Japan used to go, like _Natsume Sohseki_. You'll also see the Great Sanctuary of Mishima (_Mishima Taisha_, 三嶋大社), one of the most ancient shrines in Japan.

I personally loved _Izu_, and I hope being able to spend more time there, to discover it more thoroughly. People of _Izu_ are simple and openminded, and the land is marvellous. Perfect to have a break.
