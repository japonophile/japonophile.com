May 5 is "Children's Day" (_kodomo no hi_ こどもの日) in Japan, and all little boys are celebrated on that day. This feast is being prepared several days in advance, by featuring through windows or in the gardens the _koi-nobori_ (鯉幟), carps made of paper or tissue of vivid colors, symbol of power and perseverance.
