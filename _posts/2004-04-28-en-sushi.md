Probably not necessary to introduce them. _Sushi_ (寿司) are made of a thin slice of raw fish, delicately layed on a small brick of rice. The rice used to make _sushi_ is prepared by adding a mix of vinegar and sugar to freshly cooked rice, which makes it sticky and gives it a particular taste.

Although the basic elements are always the same, their is a great variety of _sushi_.![Sushi]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/04/sushi.jpg) First of all, because the number of species of fish present in the Japanese seas and around is impressive, but also because their are many ways to prepare them: rolled and wrapped in dried seaweed (_maki-zushi_, 巻寿司), with a little _[wasabi]({% post_url 2004-06-27-fr-wasabi %})_, or a little herb or leaf.

Unlike some people think, _sushi_ are not appetizers, nor even a starter, but are often taken as a full meal, and believe me, it doesn't leave you hungry.

![Sashimi]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2004/04/sashimi.jpg)Now, what about _sashimi_? It is how we call the raw fish itself, finely cut and eaten like that, with a little soy sauce.

Not confident about raw fish? It's understandable when one is not used to see _really_ fresh fish. But, I can tell you, Japanese people are extremely careful about the freshness of the fish they serve. So, just try it: you won't be disappointed!
