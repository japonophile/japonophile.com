subtitle: who created Japonophile.com?
---

My name is Antoine Choppin.
I am a Software Engineer, born in Belgium and living in Japan since 2003.

Japonophile.com is a project I started when I moved to Japan,
to share my experiences as an expatriate, and a lover of the japanese culture.

It is quite outdated, but I keep it online for the records.
